# WFC-Tile-Set-Validation
This repository holds my analysis of the wave function collapse algorithm in regard to the validation of user given tile sets.
While working with the wfc algorithm to create a chunk based game world I asked myself how I could know if a given tile set would generate an empty super state.
This question needed to be answered, since if a player would generate the world by exploring it and an empty super state would be introduced I couldn't just redo the world generation.
So I set down and derived this document to answer my questions.
